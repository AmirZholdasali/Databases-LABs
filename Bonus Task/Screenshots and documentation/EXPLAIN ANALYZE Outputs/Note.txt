Note on Index Usage in Testing: During testing with the initial small dataset (< 20 records), the PostgreSQL Query Planner preferred Sequential Scan over Index Scans because the cost of full table retrieval was lower than the I/O overhead of accessing the index. To demonstrate the correctness of the index implementation for this report, I temporarily forced index usage via SET enable_seqscan = OFF. In a production environment with thousands of transactions, the planner would naturally switch to using these indexes without manual intervention.
